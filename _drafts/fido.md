tldr: I recently bought the Gigabyte 34" M34WQ, a 144hz, 1440p monitor. This monitor is huge when it comes to my tiny MacBook Pro 16" screen. The main selling point of this monitor was the non-curved wide screen. I plan on using this screen vertically to display all my code. I have a 32" curved monitor as well, and I'll be interesting to see how well they compare and work together.

What's FIDO2, well FIDO stands for: Fast Identity Online. It is an open-source authentication standards and its main goals are to improve online security mainly via user authentication processes. There is a group, or alliance called the FIDO Alliance, which is made up of various tech companies, that come togheter to develop these processes, best practices and standards.

In the mainstream tech world the two most important FIDO standards are the: FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd factor), and the FIDO2 which is an extension of the FIDO U2F standard.
