tldr: I recently bought the Gigabyte 34" M34WQ, a 144hz, 1440p monitor. This monitor is huge when it comes to my tiny MacBook Pro 16" screen. The main selling point of this monitor was the non-curved wide screen. I plan on using this screen vertically to display all my code. I have a 32" curved monitor as well, and I'll be interesting to see how well they compare and work together.

The second selling point of this monitor was the built in [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch){:target="_blank"} switch. I can now connect my wireless mouse and keyboard to the USB ports in the back of the monitor, as well as a displayport, and USB-B cable to my main gaming PC, and connect a USB-C / Thunderbolt cable to and from my MacBook to the monitor. With one easy button click I can switch the USB, and video inputs between either my main PC and my Mac, isn't that just great!  

The Gigabyte 34" M34WQ is a IPS screen, so it look great, and with a selling price of just: 580€ (≈625$) it is a barging, normally you'd have to pay double or more often triple that amount for a 1440p, 144hz, 34" widescreen IPS monitor.

All in all it works great for development, just browsing, and gaming. I have a RTX-3070 in my main PC, and it handles the 34" very nice.

So its a great widescreen monitor IPS monitor, with built in KVM at half the price of other models. Get this monitor now!
