## SIM Swapping Attacks
SIM swapping, simjacking and/or port-out scams are types of fraud and phishing attacks that works by taking over SIM (subscriber identity module) cards. This is done by changing the phone number of a SIM card. This service is a genuine type of customer support and it's often carried out by service providers to aid when a customer buys a new phone, switches service providers, handles lost phones or when a device gets stolen.

## SIM Cards
A SIM card is the small chip or card that is given to you by your mobile provider so that you can make and receive phone calls and SMS messages.

## Swapping Dangers
Getting your phone number stolen is quite bad due to the fact that the person who controls your number will get all your text messages, and most importantly your two-factor or other authentication messages. Thereby, they have a greater chance of taking control and accessing your accounts.
