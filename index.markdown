## Hi & Welcome To Me! 
---
My name is Samuel Granvik, I'm a developer, nerd, dog lover and IT engineer from Finland.

This website holds my personal interests, some *future* blog posts, and the base information of me, what I'm doing and what I'm interested in.

This static website has been developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and it's hosted on my public GitHub, as a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).
